SEIR Modelling COVID-19 to Analyse Government Strategies in the UK - Used data to find parameters
Since March 2020, when The World Health Organization officially acknowledged the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, every country has put in
efforts to form strategies to contain said pandemic. By data we can see how
effective these strategies are, but what if they were used from day 1 of the
pandemic? This study aims to analyse then compare the main strategies
used by the UK government. To then find the ideal strategy or the ideal
combination of strategies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing
relative to a no-policy environment, we can observe if there is a need for
strategies to begin with. Then considering the NHS capacity we can conclude if the strategy was successful at avoiding a healthcare crisis, which is
the most crucial part of defining a good strategy in this piece.
These comparisons via observation of graphs made using the SEIR model,
corresponding to the no-policy environment and each strategy. Separately
plotting hospitalisations, ICU cases with their respective thresholds in terms
of hospital beds available.
The results show that strategies are necessary to contain the COVID-19
pandemic, with the hospitalisations in the no-policy environment significantly greater than every other strategy. The ideal strategy is given by
vaccinations, but to implement said strategy we need time to develop vaccinations which can be bought by other strategies.
